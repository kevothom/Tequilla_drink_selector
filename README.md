# Tequilla_drink_selector

This project is an app that asks for an user's name, age, and then the type of drink
they would like to order. If the user's are under 21 yrs. old they cannot order alcohol.
If they decide to order Tequilla, they will get the cost of the Tequilla along with the 
taxes already applied to the total price.
